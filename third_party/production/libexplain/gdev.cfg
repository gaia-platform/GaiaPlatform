# The configure script used by the libexplain build doesn't seem to respect the
# set value of CC as the linker frontend in libtool link mode, so we end up
# passing LDFLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld-10 to gcc, which doesn't like it because it's
# not in the canonical form -fuse-ld={bfd,gold,lld}. Clang has no problem with
# -fuse-ld=lld-10, but we need to make gcc happy, so we rely on the fact that
# we've already symlinked ld.lld to ld.lld-10 and pass LDFLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld to
# configure instead.
