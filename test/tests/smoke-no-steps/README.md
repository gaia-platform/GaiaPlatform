# Test Description

The `smoke-no-steps` test is an experimental test.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this test is to provide for a simple
manner in which to gather information on what is required
to setup the tests for execution.

## Discussion

This test performs the common setup that is used in
each of the other tests, but does not enact any rules.
This allows for measurements related to the setup of
the tests to be included with the other test measurements.
