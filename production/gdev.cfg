# Examples

## enable_if and enable_if_not

{enable_if('translation_engine')}# This is an example line of what could be run \
    # if we use `gdev build --cfg-enables translation_engine`.
{enable_if_not('translation_engine')}# This is an example line of what could be \
    # if we use `gdev build`, but don't specify `--cfg-includes \
    # translation_engine`.

# Note that the `[run]` section above is the first valid `[run]` section that
# the cfg parser will evaluate, so it is the one that is always used. The
# following examples of gated `[run]` sections are shadowed by the one above.

{enable_if('translation_engine')}[run]
# alternatively, you could have an entire `[run]` section gated with the above \
# line. If you do so, you should also gate the default `[run]` section with \
# `enable_if_not('translation_engine')`.
{enable_if_not('translation_engine')}[run]

## enable_if_any, enable_if_not_any, enable_if_all, enable_if_not_all

# Similar the enable_if and enable_if_not, but multiple keywords may be
# specified. A good example would be
cmake \
    {enable_if_not_any('debug', 'production_debug')}-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    {enable_if_any('debug', 'production_debug')}-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    {source_dir('production')}
