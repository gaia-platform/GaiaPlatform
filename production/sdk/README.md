# Getting Started with the Gaia SDK

This document provides guidance on setting up the Gaia SDK, which includes the Gaia Database Server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that you have the following prerequisites:

-   Ubuntu Linux 20.04
-   A machine that supports the x64 architecture.

The Gaia SDK installer installs the Gaia tools and Clang 10.

CMake is the officially supported method for building Gaia applications. In addition, the Gaia SDK uses CMake to automate code generation from DDL and ruleset files.

To install CMake, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

To build Gaia exmamples using CMake and make tools, specify the Clang compiler by setting the following variables in your environment:

```bash
export CC=/usr/bin/clang-10
export CPP=/usr/bin/clang-cpp-10
export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++-10
export LDFLAGS="-B/usr/lib/llvm-10/bin/ -fuse-ld=lld"
```

## Download the Gaia SDK

The Gaia SDK is delivered as a Debian software package (DEB): 

gaia-x.y.z_amd64.deb

Where x.y.z represents the Gaia version number.

The Gaia SDK includes the Database Server executable and the Gaia Declarative C++ SDK.

To download the package, use the URL that you were sent in your welcome email.

## Install the package

You must have sudo privileges to install the package.

To install the package:

1.  Navigate to the folder that contains the downloaded package.
2.  At the command prompt, replace the x.y.z with the correct version number and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ./gaia-x.y.z_amd64.deb
    ```

To remove the package:

1.  At the command prompt, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get remove gaia
    ```

To update the package, remove it and install the updated package:

1.  Download the updated package.
2.  Remove the currently installed package, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get remove gaia
    ```
3.  Navigate to the folder that contains the updated package.
4.  After replacing the x.y.z with the version number of the package that you are installing, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ./gaia-x.y.z_amd64.deb
    ```

### Installed components

    Include files for the Gaia Platform.
/opt/gaia/lib
    Library files for the Gaia Platform.
</pre>

## Start the Gaia server

To build or run any solution that is based on the Gaia Platform, the Gaia server must be running .

We recommend that you don't run gaia\_db\_server under the root user. As with any daemon process that is accessible to the outside, running the Database Server process as root, or any other account with special access rights, is a security risk. As best practice in production, run Gaia under a separate user account. This user account should only own the data that is managed by the server, and should not be used to run other daemons. For example, using the user `nobody` is not recommended.

To prevent a compromised server process from modifying the Gaia executables, the user account must not own the Gaia executable files.

Gaia server command line arguments:

| Option  | Description  |
|---|---|
| --persistence \<mode> | If not specified, the default mode is enabled.<br>The data location is specified with --data-dir.<br>- <enabled>: Persist data [default].<br>- <disabled>: Do not persist any data.<br>- <disabled-after-recovery>: Load data from the datastore and disable persistence.  | 
| --data-dir \<database-folder-path> | Specifies the location in which to store the database.  |
| --configuration-file-path \<config-file-name> | Specifies the location in which to store the Gaia configuration file.  |
| --reinitialize-persistent-store | All previous changes to the database are deleted from persistent storage and will not be visible after the Database Server is started, Changes to the database made while the Database Server is running will be visible after it is restarted.  | 

### Configuration settings

### Overcommit policy

The Database Server can run normally with an overcommit policy value of 0 (heuristic overcommit.), but might become unstable under rare conditions.

To ensure stable performance under all conditions, we recommend changing the overcommit policy to 1 (always overcommit.)

To temporarily enable this policy, open a shell with root privileges and type the following command:

```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
```

To permanently enable this policy:

1. Open /etc/sysctl.conf in an editor with root privileges and add the line

    vm.overcommit_memory=1

2. Save the file, and in a shell with root privileges type

    sysctl -p
  
### Open file descriptor limit

The Database Server requires a per-process open file descriptor limit of at least 65535.

To temporarily set the minimum open file descriptor limit, open a shell with root privileges and type the following command:

```bash
  ulimit -n 65535
```

To permanently set the minimum open file descriptor limit:

1. Open /etc/security/limits.conf in an editor with root privileges and add the following lines:
    
    ```
    * soft nofile 65535
    * hard nofile 65535
    ```

    **Note**: For enhanced security, replace the wild card '*' in these file entries with the user name of the account that is running the  Database Server.

2. Save the file and start a new terminal session.

### Starting the Gaia Database Server on a machine that supports systemd

To start the server on a machine that supports systemd:

```bash
sudo systemctl start gaia
```

### Starting the Gaia Database Server on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

When starting the Database Server on WSL, use the --data-dir argument to specify the location to store the database. We recommend that you store it locally in ~/.local/gaia/db.

To start the server on Ubuntu and run it in the background on WSL2 (Gaia has not been tested on WSL1):

```bash
gaia_db_server --data-dir ~/.local/gaia/db &
```
