// The ASSERT macros defined in this file are used for internal validation checks
// that are meant to be performed in both debug and retail builds.
//
// These ASSERTs provide a mechanism for failing execution as soon as an issue is detected,
// which should surface errors early on and should prevent more expensive investigations.
//
// A way to disable these ASSERTs (via corresponding defines) is provided mainly as a mechanism
// for determining if they contribute any negative execution impact.
//
// The ASSERT message is wrapped within an if that is evaluated only if the condition is false.
// For this reason is optimal to put string concatenation within the ASSERT, eg.
// ASSERT_PRECONDITION(gaia_fmt::format("Message {}", 123).c_str());
