// This function will block until ALL currently scheduled rules and any rules they cause to be invoked by
// changes to the database are done executing.  Note that this is a best effort API.  It is the application's
// responsibility to ensure that other threads are not making database changes that also will schedule rules.
// In this case, the function may never return (a never ending cycle of rules being run), or may return after
// the current set of rules has finished but before the next set of rules has been scheduled.  A common usage
// pattern of this function is the following:
//
// begin_transaction();
// ... make db changes that would fire a set of rules
// commit_transaction();
// gaia::rules::test::wait_for_rules_to_complete();
// ... verify that rules were or were not executed per the test
//
