/**
 * TODO: Create sub-classes for different types of relationships.
 *
 * A relationship describes the logical connection between two Gaia types whose
 * direct access classes have methods to to allow objects of one type to
 * directly visit the objects of the other type in the relationship.
 *
 * To facilitate efficient traversal of objects in relationships, the database
 * will allocate reference slots (in the object header before the data payload)
 * for each relationship the object is in.
 *
 * The objects in a relationship can form two different topologies from the
 * references that connect them: one without an anchor node and one with an
 * anchor node. The connected data structures are called reference chain and
 * reference anchor chain respectively.
 *
 * A reference chain will look like the following graph.
 *
 *   +---------------------------------------+
 *   |                                       |
 *   |  +-----------------------+            |
 *   |  |                       |            |
 *   v  v                       |            |
 *  +----+  <--  +----+       +----+       +----+
 *  | P  |  -->  | C1 |  -->  | C2 |  -->  | C3 |
 *  +----+       +----+       +----+       +----+
 *
 *
 * In the above graph, P is a parent node; C1, C2, and C3 are child nodes. A
 * parent node has one reference at the 'first_child_offset' slot pointing to
 * the first child node in the list. Each child node has two references: one at
 * the 'next_child_offset' slot pointing to the next child in the list; another
 * at the 'parent_offset' slot pointing to the parent node.
 *
 * A reference anchor chain will look like the following graph.
 *
 *                +---------------------------------------+
 *                |                                       |
 *                |  +-----------------------+            |
 *                |  |                       |            |
 *                v  v                       |            |
 *  +----+  -->  +----+  <--  +----+       +----+       +----+
 *  | P  |  <--  | A  |  -->  | C1 |  -->  | C2 |  -->  | C3 |
 *  +----+       +----+       +----+  <--  +----+  <--  +----+
 *
 * In the above graph, P is a parent node; A is an anchor node; C1, C2, and C3
 * are child nodes. A parent node has one reference at the 'first_child_offset'
 * slot pointing to the anchor node. An anchor node has two references: one at
 * the 'first_child_offset' slot pointing to the first child node in the list;
 * one at the 'parent_offset' slot pointing to the parent node. Each child node
 * has three references: one at the 'next_child_offset' slot pointing to the
 * next child in the list; one at the 'prev_child_offset' slot pointing to the
 * previous node in the list; one at the 'parent_offset' slot pointing to the
 * anchor node.
