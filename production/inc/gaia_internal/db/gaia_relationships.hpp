/**
 * TODO: Create sub-classes for different types of relationships.
 *
 * A relationship describes the logical connection between two Gaia types whose
 * direct access classes have methods to allow objects of the given type to
 * visit the other object in the relationship directly.
 *
 * To facilitate efficient traversal of objects in relationships, database will
 * allocate reference slots (in the object header before the data payload) for
 * each relationship the object is in.
 *
 * The objects in a relationship can form two different typologies from the
 * references that connect them: one with an anchor node and one without.
 *
 * A reference chain without a anchor node will look like the following graph.
 *
 *          +----------+
 *          v          |
 *         +----+     +----+     +----+     +----+
 *      +> | P  | --> | C1 | --> | C2 | --> | C3 |
 *      |  +----+     +----+     +----+     +----+
 *      |    ^                     |          |
 *      |    +---------------------+          |
 *      |                                     |
 *      |                                     |
 *      +-------------------------------------+
 *
 * In the above graph, P is a parent node; C1, C2, and C3 are child nodes. A
 * parent node has one reference at the 'first_child_offset' slot pointing to
 * the first child node in the list. Each child node has two references: one at
 * the 'next_child_offset' slot pointing to the next child in the list; another
 * at the 'parent_offset' slot pointing to the parent node.
 *
 * A reference chain with anchor node will look like the following graph.
 *
 *              +------------------------------------+
 *              |                                    |
 *              |                                    |
 *              |    +--------------------+          |
 *              v    v                    |          |
 *  +----+     +--------+     +----+     +----+     +----+
 *  | P  | --> |        | --> |    | --> |    | --> |    |

 *    ^        |        |     |    |     |    |     |    |
 *    +------- |   A    | <-- | C1 | <-- | C2 | <-- | C3 |
 *             |        |     |    |     |    |     |    |
 *             |        |     |    |     |    |     |    |
 *             |        | <-- |    |     |    |     |    |
