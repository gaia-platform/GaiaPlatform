// This is a meta-header containing the complete headers for building/evaluating expressions.
//
// The expression infrastructure consists of the following components:
//
// 1) Accessors - Expression AST fragments created during code generation. This represents
//    a proxy of a field to an object.
// 2) Expression builders - These are operator overloads and objects that will combine AST
//    fragments together into an executable expression tree.
// 3) Execution/Evaluation - All expression objects are also functors accepting a bind context that
//    will cause the expression to be evaluated against that context.
