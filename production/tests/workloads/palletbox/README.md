# Palletbox Test Workload

## Goals

The main goals of this workload are as follows:
- provide a test of a more real-world scenario
- provide exercising of hybrid indices
- provide exercising of the DDL short format

## Description

This specific scenario emulates the Palletbot from the Swarm/Sandbox Demo.
It contains the three stations that the Palletbot visits during that demo, plus a configurable number of Palletbots to exercise the test with.

Note that currently only a single palletbot is provided.
However, the changes have been stated to allow for multiple robots and stations in the near future.
