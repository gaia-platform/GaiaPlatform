# Test Description

The `smoke` test is one of the foundational tests.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this test is to provide a simple and
efficient manner to test that an installed Gaia system is
up and running properly.

## Discussion

This test should quickly do a simple simulation to verify
that the Gaia system under test is working.
