# Gaia Catalog

This directory contains implementation of Gaia data definition language (DDL)
and catalog.

## API Usage
Including headers in the following directories, and linking `gaia_catalog` is
the most common way to use the catalog library. We recommend use direct access
APIs to navigate and retrieve catalog records.

- `${GAIA_INC}/public/catalog`
- `${GAIA_INC}/internal/catalog`

Linking any sub-components of catalog below are also allowed, and may even be
necessary in certain scenarios. Use it at your own discretion as the
implementation may change more frequently.

## Components

### Catalog manager
The sub-directory contains the following code.

- `catalog_manager` is a singleton class that implements all the catalog DDL APIs.
- `fbs_generator` implements FlatBuffers schema (fbs) generation APIs.
- `gaia_generate` implements Gaia extended data classes (EDC) generation APIs.

### Parser
This is the scanner-parser for Gaia DDL. We used the lex/parser generator--
`flex/bison`--to generate the C++ code for both the lexer and parser. The
lexical analysis rules are defined in [`lexer.ll`](parser/src/lexer.ll). The
grammar rules are defined in [`parser.yy`](parser/src/parser.yy). A helper or
driver class `parser_t` of the lexer-parser is defined in
[`gaia_parser.hpp`](parser/inc/gaia_parser.hpp). Most parsing usage should call
the `gaia::catalog::ddl:parser_t` instead of the generated `yy_lex` or
`yy_parser` interfaces.

Add the following directories to the include list and link `gaia_parser` to use
the parser directly.

- `${GAIA_REPO}/production/catalog/parser/inc`
- `${GAIA_PARSER_GENERATED}`

### Gaiac
This is the catalog command line tool for Gaia data definition language. It is
used for bootstrapping the EDC definitions, manual testing and development.

The tool has three modes of operation: loading, interactive, and generation.

By default without specifying any mode, `gaiac` will run under loading mode to
execute the DDL statements--translating them into catalog records--without
generating any output.

The interactive mode (`-i`) provides a REPL style command line interface to try
out the DDL. The DDL typed in will be executed, and fbs output if any will be
printed out to the console output.

Under generation mode (`-g`), the tool will generate the following two header
files either from an DDL file or a specified database.

- The FlatBuffers header for field access, `<dbname>_generated.h`
- The EDC header file `gaia_<dbname>.h`

With the two headers, a direct access source file gains access to the database
as defined by the catalog.

#### Usage
```
Usage: gaiac [options] [ddl_file]

  -p          Print parsing trace.
  -s          Print scanning trace.
  -d <dbname> Set the databse name.
  -i          Interactive prompt, as a REPL.
  -g          Generate fbs and gaia headers.
  -o <path>   Set the path to all generated files.
  -t <path>   Start the SE server (for testing purposes).
  -h          Print help information.
  <ddl_file>  Process the DDLs in the file.
              In the absence of <dbname>, the ddl file basename will be used as the database name.
              The database will be created automatically.
```

#### Examples

Enter interactive mode.

```
   gaiac -i

```

Execute DDL statements in `airport.ddl` file using the `airport` database, and
generate header files for tables in `airport` database.

```
   gaiac -g airport.ddl
```

Generate catalog direct access APIs. This is the command used for bootstrapping.

```
   gaiac -d catalog -g
```

## Databases

There are two ways to create a database and specifying a table in a database:
first, using DDL; second, using `gaiac` command. When both are specified, the
DDL definition will override the `gaiac` settings.

### Use DDL

The DDL to create database is `create database`.

To specifying a table in a database, using the composite name of the format
`[database].[table]`.

#### Examples
A database `addr_book` can be created using the following statement.

```
    create database addr_book;
```

Use the following statement to create an `employee` table in `addr_book`
database.

```
create table addr_book.employee (
    name_first: string active,
    name_last: string,
    ssn: string,
    hire_date: int64,
    email: string,
    web: string,
    manages references addr_book.employee
);
```

As a syntactic sugar, the database name can be omitted when specifying a
reference to a table in the same database.

```
    create table addr_book.address (
        street: string,
        apt_suite: string,
        city: string,
        state: string,
        postal: string,
        country: string,
        current: bool,
        addresses references employee
    );
```

### Use `gaiac`

This is the way to create and specify a database before the introduction of the
database to DDL. The `gaiac` command line usage already documented how to do
this. See the following examples for more explanation.

#### Examples
In the following command line example, an `airport` database will be created
automatically. When no database prefix is specified for table names, the tables
will be created in the `airport` database. (The database prefix can still be
used to override the database name derived from the DDL file name.)

```
   gaiac -g airport.ddl

```

The following command line will create all tables in `tmp_airport`. Because a
database name is specified via `-d`, the command will not create the database
`tmp_airport` automatically.

```
   gaiac -d tmp_airport -g airport.ddl

```

## Bootstrapping the catalog
The gaia catalog manager uses Extended Data Classes to perform operations on the
catalog itself. Compiling the catalog manager requires header files to define
the EDC classes that are used. This creates a bootstrapping issue where the
original EDC definitions must be generated first. The "code generation"
functions require `gaia_catalog.h` and `catalog_generated.h` to exist before
they can be compiled.

The current solution to this is to run the `gaiac` utility (which calls
functions in the above mentioned functions) with `-d catalog -g` to generate the
catalog strictly through the catalog manager API. The catalog initialization
invokes a function called `bootstrap_catalog()`. To build `gaiac` the first
time, a `gaia_catalog.h` was created by hand and `catalog_generated.h` was
generated from handcraft fbs definition, sufficient for the code generating
functions to operate. The `gaia_catalog.h` and `catalog_generated.h` in source
control are the ones that was generated by this bootstrapping method.

## Upgrading the catalog
If the catalog schema is ever upgraded, it will be necessary to update
`bootstrap_catalog()` method. After the bootstrap function is updated, `gaiac`
can be built and run again without parameters to generate the new
`gaia_catalog.h` and `catalog_generated.h`. After this, Gaia production should
be rebuilt with the newly generated sources.

Be sure to update
[system_table_types.hpp](../inc/internal/common/system_table_types.hpp) if new
types are added or the `type_id` of the catalog tables change.

Be sure to save the new [gaia_catalog.h](../inc/internal/catalog/gaia_catalog.h)
and [catalog_generated.h](../inc/internal/catalog/catalog_generated.h) in place
of the previous ones.

## Creating other system tables with fixed IDs
If you need to create a new system table with fixed ID, add the table type and
its ID to
[system_table_types.hpp](../inc/internal/common/system_table_types.hpp). Add the
table definition in C++ code to `catalog_manager_t::create_system_tables()`.
Build instructions to generate the direct access APIs for the table should go
under `${GAIA_REPO}/production/schemas/system`.
