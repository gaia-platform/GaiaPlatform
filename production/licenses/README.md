# licenses
This is a folder for collecting license notices for third-party code that is used in our production code.

Each specific third-party piece of code can have its specific licenses collected here in its own folder (folders should be named in ways that they clearly identify the code that they apply to).

Try to provide URLs for all licenses collected here. For standard licenses, nothing more than an URL is needed. For custom licenses, include the text of the custom license along the URL from which you picked it up. See existing entries for examples.
