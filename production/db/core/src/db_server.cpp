// Use a huge sparse array to store the txn info, where each entry is indexed by
// its begin or commit timestamp. We use 2^45 = 32TB of virtual address space
// for this array, but only the pages we actually use will ever be allocated.
// From https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting, it
// appears that MAP_NORESERVE is ignored in overcommit mode 2 (never
// overcommit), so we may need to check the `vm.overcommit_memory` sysctl and
// fail if it's set to 2. Alternatively, we could use the more tedious but
// reliable approach of using mmap(PROT_NONE) and calling
// mprotect(PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE) on any pages we actually need to use (this is
// analogous to VirtualAlloc(MEM_RESERVE) followed by VirtualAlloc(MEM_COMMIT)
// in Windows). 2^45 bytes of virtual address space holds 2^42 8-byte words, so
// we can allocate at most 2^42 timestamps over the lifetime of the process. If
// we allocate timestamps at a rate of 1M/s, we can run for about 2^22 seconds,
// or about a month and a half. If we allocate only 1K/s, we can run a thousand
// times longer: 2^32 seconds = ~128 years. If running out of timestamps is a
// concern, we can just convert the array to a circular buffer and store a
// wraparound counter separately.

// Each entry in the txn_info array is an 8-byte word, with the high bit
// indicating whether the index represents a begin or commit timestamp (they are
// allocated from the same counter). The next two bits indicate the current
// state of the txn state machine. The txn state machine's states and
// transitions are as follows: TXN_NONE -> TXN_ACTIVE -> (TXN_SUBMITTED ->
// (TXN_COMMITTED, TXN_ABORTED), TXN_TERMINATED). TXN_NONE is necessarily
// encoded as 0 since all entries of the array are zeroed when a page is
// allocated. We also introduce the pseudo-state TXN_DECIDED, encoded as the
// shared set bit in TXN_COMMITTED and TXN_ABORTED. Each active txn may assume
// the states TXN_NONE, TXN_ACTIVE, TXN_SUBMITTED, TXN_TERMINATED, while
// each submitted txn may assume the states TXN_SUBMITTED, TXN_COMMITTED,
// TXN_ABORTED, so we need 2 bits for each txn entry to represent all possible
// states. Combined with the begin/commit bit, we need to reserve the 3 high
// bits of each 64-bit entry for txn state, leaving 61 bits for other purposes.
// The remaining bits are used as follows. In the TXN_NONE state, all bits are
// 0. In the TXN_ACTIVE state, the non-state bits are currently unused, but
// they could be used for active txn information like session thread ID, session
// socket, session userfaultfd, etc. In the TXN_SUBMITTED state, the remaining
// bits always hold a commit timestamp (which is guaranteed to be at most 42
// bits per above). The commit timestamp serves as a forwarding pointer to the
// submitted txn entry for this txn. Note that the commit timestamp entry for a
// txn may be set before its begin timestamp entry has been updated, since
// multiple updates to the array cannot be made atomically without locks. (This
// is similar to insertion into a lock-free singly-linked list, where the new
// node is linked to its successor before its predecessor is linked to the new
// node.) Our algorithms are tolerant to this transient inconsistency. A commit
// timestamp entry always holds the submitted txn's log fd in the low 16 bits
// following the 3 high bits used for state (we assume that all log fds fit into
// 16 bits), and the txn's begin timestamp in the low 42 bits.

// We can always find the watermark by just scanning the txn_info array until we
// find the first begin timestamp entry not in state TXN_TERMINATED. However, we
// need to know where to start scanning from since pages toward the beginning of
// the array may have already been deallocated (as part of advancing the
// watermark, once all txn logs preceding the watermark have been scanned for
// garbage and deallocated, all pages preceding the new watermark's position in
// the array can be freed using madvise(MADV_FREE)). We can store a global
// watermark variable to cache this information, which could always be stale but
// tells us where to start scanning to find the current watermark, since the
// watermark only moves forward. This global variable is also set as part of
// advancing the watermark on termination of the oldest active txn, which is
// delegated to that txn's session thread.

    // duplicated work, by deferring helping other txns validate until all
    // necessary work is complete and we would be forced to block otherwise.
    //
    // 1. Find all committed transactions in conflict window, i.e., between our
    //    begin and commit timestamps, traversing from oldest to newest txns and
    //    testing for conflicts as we go, to allow as much time as possible for
    //    undecided txns to be validated, and for commit timestamps allocated
    //    within our conflict window to be registered. Invalidate all unknown
    //    timestamps we encounter, so no active txns can be submitted within our
    //    conflict window. Any submitted txns which have allocated a commit
    //    timestamp within our conflict window but have not yet registered their
    //    commit timestamp must now retry with a new timestamp. (This allows us
    //    to treat our conflict window as an immutable snapshot of submitted
    //    txns, without needing to acquire any locks.) Skip over all invalidated
    //    timestamps, active txns, undecided txns, and aborted txns. Repeat this
    //    phase until no newly committed txns are discovered.
    //
    // 2. Recursively validate all undecided txns in the conflict window, from
    //    oldest to newest. Note that we cannot recurse indefinitely, since by
    //    hypothesis no undecided txns can precede our begin timestamp (because
    //    a new transaction must validate any undecided transactions with commit
    //    timestamps preceding its begin timestamp before it can proceed).
    //    However, we could duplicate work with other session threads validating
    //    their committing txns. We mitigate this by 1) deferring any recursive
    //    validation until no more committed txns have been found during a
    //    repeated scan of the conflict window, 2) tracking all txns' validation
    //    status in their commit timestamp entries, and 3) rechecking validation
    //    status for the current txn after scanning each possibly conflicting
    //    txn log (and aborting validation if it has already been validated).
    //
    // 3. Test any committed txns validated in the preceding step for conflicts.
    //    (This also includes any txns which were undecided in the first pass
    //    but committed before the second pass.)
    //
    // 4. If any of these steps finds that our write set conflicts with the
    //    write set of any committed txn, we must abort. Otherwise, we commit.
    //    In either case, we set the decided state in our commit timestamp entry
    //    and return the commit decision to the client.
