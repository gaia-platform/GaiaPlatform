# To run the FDW tests, you need to perform the following steps:
# (1) Run cmake with the -DEXECUTE_FDW_TESTS=ON argument.
# (2) Execute 'make install' under build/sql after running make,
# to install the FDW binaries.
# (3) Ensure that local authentication for user postgres
# is set to 'trust' in file /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf.
# (4) Stop and restart Postgres service after doing (2) or (3).
