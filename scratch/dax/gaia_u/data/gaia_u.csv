#
# I am Not Joking -> 11 students, added in increasing order (so first come, first serve)
# Throwing Dice -> 8 students
# Strange Loops -> 4 students
# Reusable Rockets -> 10 students
#
# Need to make the contrived scenario:
# demonstrate location change
# demonstrate time-only change ?
# demonstrate time and location change (need to events at the same time that can only use the bigger room!)
# demonstrate dropping enrollments
#
# Need to write code for dropping enrollments in the right order
# Pretty up output
