Add tracing to rule worker thread queues

maybe create T_in and T_out tables to avoid concurrency issues?

Run with only one background thread for simulation?

Iteration and threading is nice,but need to syncronize. I.e. would like to transform camera and radar data in parallel then let BLC know
when that is done.

Tenet:  thou shalt not do update diffs against signal data

If we model all data as inserts, then we need a fast "GC" mechaism, or at lesat 

Add an overload to commit to suppress firing events
Add an API for exponential backoff for retrying transaction serialization errors
insert/delete churn
