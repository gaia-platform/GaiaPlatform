Still looking for empty docker and CI

shared library for rules / app mode

where where
maybe here is where we build incubator demo and hello world app (one build to rule them?)

tx id (tracing)

How do we expose the index work?  (what's the end to end story for indices, parallel to gaia ptr), re-use the same gaia_ptr API, what doe we do with an index, query optimie


Rules - PEGA
Each node is a process (server process), each server had their own copy of everything.
Each process only populated the rules they were using.
Each process first attempt to dynamically load from the database to get its binary (database of rules)

David's view:  two separate nodes in the cluster, "VOB", one node working in boarding area, one working on luggage distrubtion.  Person checking in kicks off rules in separate systems.
Shared libraries, by ruleset or "all rules"?
Pick and choose what we can bring in memory.  Compile all rulesets into a single shared library.

Future:
Dynamic recompile of rules < Danger Will Robbins (dax edit)
